<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Economics × Linguistics × AI</p>
<p>Grew up in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Studied and lived in South Korea and across Europe.</p>
<p>Started early in China’s outbound investment and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Now working on global brand and international growth for GLM models at Z.AI, based in Tsinghua Science Park.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>Own global brand, partnerships, and ecosystem strategy for GLM models.</p>
<p>Explore how LLM can truly serve developers worldwide.</p>
<p>Build two-way, trust-based global partnerships that compound over time.</p>

<h2>How I Think</h2>
<p>Most people wait for perfect conditions before they start.</p>
<p>The top 1% start first, and refine along the way.</p>

<p>Extreme focus is one of the most underestimated skills.</p>
<p>You never fail, you either succeed or you learn.</p>

<p>The best partnerships are leverage.</p>
<p>With enough agency, almost anything can become value, and value is always exchangeable.</p>

<h2>On AI</h2>
<p>Taste and judgment in an AI-saturated world matter more than ever.</p>
<p>Different regions and communities expect different things from AI.</p>
<p>The work is to go deeper, broader, and closer to human needs through better products.</p>

<h2>What I’m Interested In</h2>
<p>I love hearing from people with different backgrounds and perspectives</p>
<p>who want to share bold, original ideas.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in building together</p>
<p>whether around z.ai, GLM, or global collaboration</p>
<p>DM me or email me.</p>
<p>I’d genuinely love to hear what you’re thinking.</p>
